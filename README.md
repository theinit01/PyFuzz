#üêç PyFuzz - Python Subdomain and Directory Fuzzer
PyFuzz is a lightweight and efficient Python-based subdomain and directory fuzzer tool that helps in finding hidden subdomains and directories on a target website.
## Installation
To use PyFuzz, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download and install Python 3 from the official Python website.

Once you have Python 3 installed, follow these steps to install PyFuzz:

1. Clone the PyFuzz repository to your local system using git clone https://github.com/theinit01/PyFuzz.git or download the source code from the repository and extract it to a local directory.
2. Navigate to the PyFuzz directory in your terminal/command prompt.
3. Install the required Python modules using ```pip install -r requirements.txt.```

## Usage
To use PyFuzz, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the PyFuzz directory in your terminal/command prompt.
2. Run python pyfuzz.py -h to view the help menu and see the available options.
3. Must Use the -url to specify the target URL, -wordlist-dir to specify the wordlist.
4. ```python pyfuzz1.py -url https://example.com/FUZZ -wordlist word_lists/```
5. Wait for PyFuzz to complete scanning the target website.
6. Review the results in the specified output format, such as CSV, JSON, or plain text.

## Rate Limiting Feature
We've recently added a rate limiting feature to PyFuzz. This feature helps control the number of requests per second, preventing overload of the target server. Rate limiting is an important consideration to avoid inadvertently affecting the availability of the target.
